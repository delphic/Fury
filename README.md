Fury
====

Fury (as in the mythical creature) - a WebGL based game engine / framework.

The ideal being to allow easier low level access to WebGL, whilst not to forcing any abstractions upon the user.

Standards or GTFO - This means WebGL and Web Audio API (without fall backs).

A single vector implementation across rendering, physics and game logic (glMatrix).

Focus on fast JavaScript - low GC - without compromising readability.

For more information look in the docs folder.
