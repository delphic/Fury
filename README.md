Fury
====

Fury (as in the mythical creature) - a WebGL based game engine / framework.

The ideal being to allow easy low level access to WebGL, whilst not to forcing any unnecessary abstractions upon the user.

Standards Focused - using WebGL2 and Web Audio API without fall backs.

A single vector implementation across rendering, physics and game logic (glMatrix).

Focus on fast JavaScript, low garbage allocations, without compromising readability.

For more information look in the docs folder.
